                <div class="text">The Sex Pistols were formed in London in 1975
                    and quickly became one of the most influential bands in the
                    emerging punk rock movement. The original lineup consisted
                    of Johnny Rotten on vocals, Steve Jones on guitar, Paul Cook
                    on drums, and Glen Matlock on bass. Managed by Malcolm McLaren,
                    the band set out to disrupt the mainstream music scene with
                    their raw, aggressive sound and rebellious attitude. They quickly
                    gained a following in London's underground music scene.</div>
                <div class="textimg1">
                    <div class="text">In 1976, the band released their debut single, "Anarchy
                        in the U.K.", which became a rallying cry for disaffected
                        youth. The song’s bold, anti-establishment lyrics sparked
                        controversy and drew widespread media attention, turning
                        the band into public enemies of the British establishment.
                        Despite the backlash, their growing notoriety only fueled
                        their rise in the punk scene.</div>

                        <div class="text">In early 1977, Glen Matlock was replaced by Sid Vicious,
                            a figure who embodied the band's chaotic and rebellious image.
                            Sid’s lack of musical experience was overshadowed by his punk persona.
                            That same year, the band released "God Save the Queen," a blistering
                            attack on the monarchy that coincided with Queen Elizabeth II’s Silver
                            Jubilee. The song was banned by many radio stations, including the BBC,
                            but it became an underground hit and symbol of punk defiance.

                        <div class="text">
                            By 1978, internal tensions, particularly due to Sid Vicious’s drug addiction,
                            began to tear the band apart. Their chaotic and poorly received U.S. tour
                            culminated in a disastrous final show in San Francisco, after which the band
                            broke up. Shortly after, Sid Vicious was arrested for the murder of Nancy
                            Spungen and died of a heroin overdose in 1979. Despite their short-lived career,
                            the Sex Pistols’ influence on punk rock and youth culture remains enduring,
                            as they continue to be remembered as pioneers of rebellion in music.
